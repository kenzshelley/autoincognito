# AutoIncognito

Tiny chrome extension that will automatically open links from specified domains
in an incognito window. Let's user avoid things like article limits on news
sites.

## Notes: 
* This does not actually prevent the link from being open in the original
  window; it just additionally opens it in incognito mode
